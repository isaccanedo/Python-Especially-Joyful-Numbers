# Especially Joyful Numbers
# Level: 7kyu
'''
Positive integers that are divisible exactly by the sum of their digits are called Harshad numbers, 
see Wikipedia for further details.
The first few Harshad numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,18,...
Example: Consider the number n=1729.
    The digit sum, s = 1 + 7 + 2 + 9 = 19 and s divides n exactly 91 times.
We are interested in Harshad numbers where the product of s, and s with the digits reversed, gives the 
original number n. Continuing with the above example...
    reversing s gives 91 and
    19 x 91 = 1729 the number n that we started with.
Write a function numberJoy() which tests if a positive integer n is Harshad and returns True if the 
product of its digit sum, and its digit sum reversed, equals n. Otherwise return False.
Take the positive integers to be 1,2,3,4,...

def numberJoy(n):
    sum_n = sum([int(i) for i in str(n)])
    if n % sum_n != 0:
        return False
    if sum_n*(int(str(sum_n)[::-1])) != n:
        return False
    return True

# Test Cases

print(numberJoy(1729))
print(numberJoy(1997))
